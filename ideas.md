# Motor Apple Enterprise Pursuit

### Notes to keep in mind when designing the mod
- Don’t drag out steps. If it needs old materials, make them easier to get with progression.
- Don’t be too harsh. Balance it out.
- Don’t make the food mistake from TFC.
- Steel can’t be the end. Include semi-automation and better storage maybe?
- Create Integration (when on 1.20 fabric)
- Encourage not dying somehow. Maybe time travel x number of days?

### Tiers of metal progression
- Bronze (Copper + other metals can produce differing strength alloys)
- Brass (Zinc + Copper, Copper + Zinc + Tin, Copper + Zinc + Lead)
- Tungsten (Pretty short age. used for heating up which is required for steel age.)
- Steel (5 optional stages. the higher the stage the stronger/less steel you need)
- Electronic (A combination of the above + gold and others)

### Dumb ideas not to keep from TFC
- Napping
- Poorly synced Server and Client
- Friendlier alloying 
- Recursive Crafting

### Misc new ideas
- metals and food cannot be in the same container
- tungsten age introduces heated containers allowing for storage of molten materials
- Slaves which can do basic tasks
- Trains with different stages. the higher the stage the higher the speed. should always be faster than sprinting
- A progression of flight ability. Steel + Sticks + lightweight materials. 1 Per person. requires coal power
- Concrete but it cracks without rebar.
- Reduce clay use as much as possible. Fuck clay.
- "Contraptions" will be buildable throughout brass onwards.
- Coffee and Tea
- falling to your death destroys pottery such as water jug
- Opal as a durable sharp rock. 
- Optional water cutting instead of heating if far enough and got pressure system

### Things to figure out
- Power
- Make gravel and sand easier to get

### Rocks present in game
- slate (blue, dark gray)
- pumice (white)
- conglomerate (greenish gray with different shades of gray in it. gravel can be extracted)
- hornfels (layers)
- rhyolite (blue-black, orange washed out, gray)

### Very Early Game Stages
1. use rocks on floor to break wood
2. make a basic house and basic crafting table
3. Next day attach sticks to the rock on basic crafting table after breaking grass for plant fibers
4. cut more trees and pile sticks up and put dirt on top
5. Find a type of grass which can act as a tinder and start a basic fire. Use this to process food. cooked food lasts forever
6. start digging. copper and aluminum will be the most common ores on surface level. this can make a basic brass with the current level of heat.
7. they will need to use a flat material such as large plant leaves to raise up the temperature to alloy the metals. this can then be combined with a stick to make bronze tools or combined with X other item to make bronze age items. all items at this point will be poorly forged and the ratio can change. Ideal ratio for Bronze is 11% aluminium and 89% copper
